## Overview

Hi! My Name is Sambhav Jain. 

This repository in an index to my participation in the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. 
You can find all my work  in ```codes``` dir on ```master```.      

I feel that sometimes I write pretty decent codes. 
However, most of the time my codes contain tiny-errors and bugs which must be rectified as soon as possible. 
I need you to do that for me.

This is your contributing guidelines which must be followed in order to [successfully contribute](#successfully-contribute) to this repository. 
So, here's how this works:

#### What's welcome:
- Code optimizations
- Put comments wherever neccessary
- [Relevant changes](#relevant-changes) in codes
- Improvements in code-less files
- Feel free to suggest codes to be included
- Good (and appropriate) issues

#### What's not:
- Non-adherence to the guidelines
- Damage to files or property or consent
- Inappropriate use of [language](#language)
- Conflicting PRs

#### How to contribute?
Claim your issue and start working on it. When done, push your code and create a PR so that I get notified of your changes.
The format of commit and PR must remain as follows:

```
CHANGES-YOU-MADE by user:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME

For example:

refactored README.md by user:sambhav2612
```

Commit Desciption must be a short and meaningful message that describes the change(s) you made to the file(s).  
However, the description of the PRs must include the link to the issue you just commited to. This will help:
```
This pull request is with respect to the issue #(SELECT-YOUR-ISSSUE-FROM-THE-DROPDOWN-MENU)
```

Also, you **must** add yourself to the ```CONTRIBUTORS.md``` file on ```master``` as follows:
```
- YOUR-FULL-NAME @[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME](LINK TO YOUR GITHUB PROFILE)

For example:

- Sambhav Jain @[sambhav2612](https://github.com/sambhav2612)
```

- <a id="successfully-contribute">Successful contribution means getting your PRs approved and merged after you made your changes in affect within this repository.</a>     
- <a id="relevant-changes">Relevant changes are those changes which make some meaning and relevance to the previous codes.</a>
